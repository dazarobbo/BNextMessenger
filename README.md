This isn't ready to be published on the Chrome web store just yet, but if you'd like to try it out here's what you'll need to do:

1. Download the source from github by clicking the Download ZIP button on the right hand side of the page.
2. Unzip the contents and put the directory somewhere such as your desktop. By default, you should see a new directory named "BNextMessenger-master".
3. Go to the Extensions page in Chrome and check the developer mode in the top right hand corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked extension" and select the directory you unzipped.

That's it!

**NOTE: the extension could break, malfunction, do unintended things, become a 747, etc... However, it does do what it's supposed to. Periodically uninstalling and reinstalling it and disabling it from the Chrome Extensions page would be a good idea.**
